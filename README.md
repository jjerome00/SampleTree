# SampleTree
Sample of a svg tree

This is a sample project that displays an svg image of a tree.  

I've been experimenting with different ways of showing the leafs - either hiding them or changing their color to gray.


## The SVG File

I found a tree vector with a free attribution license:

* The designer:
<a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/tree-leaves">Tree Leaves Vectors by Vecteezy</a>

I modified the original document to give each leaf its own id. This way I can render it visible or invisible using css.
